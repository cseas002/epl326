Achille-Claude Debussy (French: [aʃil klod dəbysi], 22 August 1862 – 25
March 1918), known since the 1890s as Claude-Achille Debussy or Claude
Debussy, was a French composer. He and Maurice Ravel were the most prominent
figures associated with Impressionist music, though Debussy disliked the term
when applied to his compositions. He was made Chevalier of the Legion of
Honour in 1903. He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th
and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and
chromaticism influenced many composers who followed.
